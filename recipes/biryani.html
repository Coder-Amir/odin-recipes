        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Spices (cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves)</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marination (if using meat): Marinate the meat with yogurt, spices, ginger, garlic, and a bit of oil. Let it sit for a few hours or overnight for maximum flavor.</li>
            <li>Rice Preparation: Wash and soak the basmati rice. Parboil the rice with whole spices and drain when it's 70-80% cooked. This ensures the rice doesn't become overcooked when layered with the meat.</li>
            <li>Sauté Onions: In a large pot, sauté sliced onions until golden brown. Remove and set aside for later use.</li>
            <li>Sauté Onions: In a large pot, sauté sliced onions until golden brown. Remove and set aside for later use.</li>
            <li>Saffron Infusion: Dissolve saffron strands in warm milk and drizzle it over the rice for a rich color and aroma.</li>
            <li>Sealing: Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or dough to seal in steam and flavors.</li>
            <li>Cooking: Cook on low heat (dum cooking) for about 20-30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the rice to absorb the aromas.</li>
            <li>Resting: Once cooked, let the biryani rest for a few minutes off the heat. This allows the flavors to further develop and the rice to fluff up.</li>
            <li>Garnishing: Before serving, gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers. Garnish with additional fried onions, mint, cilantro, and nuts if desired.</li>
            <li>Serving: Serve the biryani hot with raita (yogurt dip) or a side salad</li>
        </ol>
